# 24-UnityTemp
This Unity project is used as a basic template for a 3D URP project.

## Asset Folder Structure
A common asset folder structure is applied, in which assets are organized by type. 

**NOTE:** It is best practice not to have empty folders in your project. If a folder is not applicable to your project delete it. There may also be instances in which you need a folder for assets not included in this template.  

## Extentions

The project includes the following extensions:
- **Unity Hierarchy Folders:** Creates specialized folder object for organizing game objects in Unity Hierarchy. [https://github.com/xsduan/unity-hierarchy-folders?tab=readme-ov-file](https://github.com/xsduan/unity-hierarchy-folders?tab=readme-ov-file)

> **Note:** Some of the extensions will require Git. Install the latest version of Git here [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
